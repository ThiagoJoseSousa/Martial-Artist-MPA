This project is gonna be an album that uses grid and redirect u to a page of which you can CRUD comments about the artist (It's some info on the page about him). Promises to retrieve images, and MPA as you click on an image at the homepage. No libraries used (only use if the server is done and want to know how to use an API).

Most of info was taken from node js docs of http requests https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/anatomy-of-an-http-transaction/

I ended up using browserify though, to import using require.

This was good knowledge, I even may come back to this later.

Also I found this website for regex:
